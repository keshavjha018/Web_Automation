Programs are made using Python and Selenium framework.

There are some requirements for running these programs in any system:
- Selenium
- ChromeDriver
- Python 3.10+

The keyword "PATH" used in these programs is the address of ChromeDriver in your system.
for eg: PATH = 'C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe'
