Web automation is the concept of letting software robots perform pre-defined actions, tasks, and processes on a web browser or web application.

Programs are made using Python and Selenium framework.

There are some requirements for running these programs in any system,
Your system must have these tools installed before you run any program:
- Selenium  ( pip install selenium )
- ChromeDriver  ( https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads ) Please note that your chrome browser & ChromeDriver are of same version.
- Python 3+

The keyword "PATH" used in these programs is the address of ChromeDriver in your system.
for eg:
PATH = 'C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe'
